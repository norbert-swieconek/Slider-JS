# Slider - JS
Simple automatic slider created with pure JavaScript.

## General info
Slider comes from tutorial freeCodeCamp.org but I modified it. I added arrows and dots. 

Arrows - when you click arrow then slider comes to the next or previous slide. <br>
Dots - when you click dot then slider comes to the first, second, third or fourth slide.
