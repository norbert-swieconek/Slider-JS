# Slider - JS
Simple automatic slider created with pure JavaScript.

## General info
Slider comes from tutorial freeCodeCamp.org but I modified it. I added **arrows** and **dots**. 

* **Arrows** - when you click arrow then slider comes to the next or previous slide. <br>
* **Dots** - when you click dot then slider comes to the first, second, third or fourth slide.<br><br>

This project helped me to understand difference between setInterval and setTimeout, how to use forEach and how index works in js.
